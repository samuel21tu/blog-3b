    <h1>Racism Today</h1>
    <h2>Racism is a deeply rooted system of inequality in society, based on the mistaken belief that people can be divided into races and that some races are superior to others. This ideology results in discrimination and prejudice against individuals or groups based on their ethnicity or skin color. Historically, racism has been used to justify exclusion, exploitation and violence against marginalized groups. In Brazil, racism is a reality that manifests itself both structurally and institutionally, affecting the opportunities and treatment that people receive in different aspects of life, including education, employment, housing and justice. </h2>

        <h1>The Fight Against Racism</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>The fight against racism involves recognizing and dismantling these discriminatory structures and practices. This includes anti-racist education, implementing racial equality policies, and supporting social movements that seek justice and equity. Brazilian legislation, such as Law No. 7,716/1989, criminalizes acts of racism and establishes punishments for those who discriminate based on race or color. Furthermore, dates such as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, on March 21, serve to raise awareness and promote actions against racism around the world.
        <br><br>
        It is essential that society recognizes the existence of racism and commits to its eradication. This involves a collective effort to change attitudes, behaviors and systems that perpetuate racial inequality. Education plays a crucial role in this process, providing knowledge and tools to combat prejudice and promote inclusion. The history of racism is long and complex, and overcoming it requires an ongoing commitment to social justice and human dignity. The fight against racism is a fight for a more just and equal world, where everyone can live free from discrimination and prejudice.</h2>
